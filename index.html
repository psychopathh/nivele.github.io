                <div class="text">
                  <p>Most likely you already tried to smooth out your cellulite with the help of other creams, and it’s likely that they were of no help. But Nivele is an unusual cream. It implements a new technology of disintegrating active substances to the size of nanoparticles. This is why active substances of the cream easily penetrate all skin layers and reach the area where cellulite is formed, the subcutaneous fatty tissue. <span>Once there, active substances of the cream quickly destroy the accumulation of fat and smooth out the ugly bumps.</span></p>
                  <p>Since Nivele cream is aimed at eliminating the causes of cellulite, it helps at all stages, including the severe cases of cellulite. <span class="pink">In effect, it’s similar to physical exercise, it also improves metabolism in problematic zones.</span></p>

                        <p><span>username </span>That praised cream for cellulite, Nivele, helped me as well. Now I am no longer ashamed of going to the beach, I didn’t know what to do before. 😱 What I liked the most is that the effect is achievable without any exercising. You just apply the cream, and cellulite disappears on its own 👍 👍</p>

                        <p>The cream is wonderful! I used to have cellulite, my legs suffered from it for many years. I tried everything, from different creams and folk remedies to parlour anti-cellulite programs. Nothing helped me like Nivele. 90-95% of cellulite disappeared within one month only! The cream is awesome, especially at such a price. It’s a pleasant surprise.</p>

                        <p>I liked the effect of this cream. My skin did become smoother, more even and resilient. I didn’t have severe cellulite (it appeared only a couple of years ago), but orange peel disappeared completely. Additionally, starburst veins disappeared, and the colour of my skin improved. I used Nivele cream for about 2 weeks. I recommended it to a friend of mine, she liked it as well</p>

                        <p>My husband left me after I began having cellulite. I started looking very unattractive, indeed. Everything went even worse after the divorce. My doctor said it happened due to stress. As a result, I spent almost 5 years fighting cellulite. A serious inferiority complex developed during that time, I couldn’t take my clothes off even on a beach. I don’t know what would have happened, hadn’t I found out about this cream. It literally saved me. I can’t say that cellulite disappeared quickly (I had 3d stage case), but it did disappear completely! My skin is lifted and smooth again. I recommend this cream lots to everyone who hasn’t tried it yet and suffers from cellulite. Nivele cream helps even in cases of severe cellulite!</p>

                        <p>It’s a magical cream. It helped me to get rid of cellulite of the 3d stage. I was only applying the cream. I didn’t do anything else, I wasn’t following a diet or exercising. It helped me all the same. My skin became noticeably smoother and more lifted. Cellulite is not noticeable even if I squeeze my skin. I’ll use this cream all the time now. Finally, scientists have developed something worthy to fight this problem that many women encounter. Thank you very much!</p>

                  <p><span>Alma, a French contestant, had to perform at Eurovision 2017 in a short dress. </span>However, due to endless rehearsals before the competition and consequent extreme fatigue, lack of sleep, and stress, she started having a lot of cellulite on her thighs. As Alma herself said, it was so horrible she was considering performing in trousers. However, a personal cosmetologist of the performer advised her to use an innovative Nivele cream (it wasn’t in the market yet at the time). We can see how much it helped from Alma’s performance. <span>Her legs and a short dress were magnificent, matching the spirit of France. Alma admitted to our reporter that she still uses this cream, it became her favourite one.</span></p>
