Nothing helped me like Nivele. 90-95% of cellulite disappeared within one month only! The cream is awesome, especially at such a price. It‚Äôs a pleasant surprise.",

I didn‚Äôt have severe cellulite (it appeared only a couple of years ago), but orange peel disappeared completely. Additionally, starburst veins disappeared, and the colour of my skin improved. I used Nivele cream for about 2 weeks. I recommended it to a friend of mine, she liked it as well",
				"My husband left me after I began having cellulite. I started looking very unattractive, indeed. Everything went even worse after the divorce. My doctor said it happened due to stress. As a result, I spent almost 5 years fighting cellulite. A serious inferiority complex developed during that time, I couldn‚Äôt take my clothes off even on a beach. I don‚Äôt know what would have happened, hadn‚Äôt I found out about this cream. It literally saved me. I can‚Äôt say that cellulite disappeared quickly (I had 3d stage case), but it did disappear completely! My skin is lifted and smooth again. I recommend this cream lots to everyone who hasn‚Äôt tried it yet and suffers from cellulite. Nivele cream helps even in cases of severe cellulite!",
				"It‚Äôs a magical cream. It helped me to get rid of cellulite of the 3d stage. I was only applying the cream. I didn‚Äôt do anything else, I wasn‚Äôt following a diet or exercising. It helped me all the same. My skin became noticeably smoother and more lifted. Cellulite is not noticeable even if I squeeze my skin. I‚Äôll use this cream all the time now. Finally, scientists have developed something worthy to fight this problem that many women encounter. Thank you very much!"
